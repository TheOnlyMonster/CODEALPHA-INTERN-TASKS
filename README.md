# Blog Website - CodeAlpha Internship Task 3

This project is part of my internship at CodeAlpha, where I developed a responsive blog website using the MERN stack. It allowed me to challenge myself and apply the skills I learned during the internship, including clean coding, React, Node.js, MongoDB, Bootstrap for styling, and efficient usage of React Router DOM.

## Project Description

A responsive blog website is a website that is designed to adapt and display content optimally on all devices, including desktop computers, tablets, and mobile devices. With a responsive design, the website layout, images, and text automatically adjust to fit the screen size of the device used to view the website.

### Technologies Used

- Frontend:
  - React
  - Bootstrap

- Backend:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB
